And thus, any new business venture or expansion in the country needs to be reviewed carefully and strategically targeted so that the return on investment will be sustainably reasonable and more importantly the investment can be considerably less risker to the business."

    "•\tThis is clearly a problem that an online grocery retailer (i.e. ABC Online Grocery) needs to review and resolve as part of their new business venture in the country. As a startup though well-funded, they need to choose their first starting location carefully for the points highlighted above and more importantly, if this is successful, they will be able to replicate the same success fairly quickly; so first mover advantage is critical for this business and thereby the choice of location (i.e. neighborhood) is important to them too."

The objective is to locate and recommend to the management which neighborhood will be the best choice to start off their first online grocery delivery services. The management also expects to understand the rationale of the recommendations in the report."
